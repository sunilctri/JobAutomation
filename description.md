## Introduction

We believe human progress will come from augmenting AI to the way we work. We help organisations scale results, not their headcount, with AI and automation. We achieve this through three core business areas: AI Readiness, AI Agents and Retail Media.

With Xephyr, you will get in on the ground floor of a fast-paced startup where your efforts have a direct impact on the success of our mission. You’ll be at the forefront of how our work with data has been evolving with AI, giving you early access to the AI-driven toolkit shaping the future of our industry. This in turn helps you develop your future-proof skillset that goes far beyond traditional analytics.

You’ll be exposed to a wide range of projects, tools, and real-world problems. You’ll work directly with clients, contribute to strategic decisions, and learn from seasoned data leaders who will continue to push you to be your best.

If you're ambitious, eager to learn, and want to move fast, Xephyr will give you the edge: the skills, the experience, and the platform to lead the next era of analytics. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to hear from you.

## Role summary

We’re looking for a sharp, curious data analyst to join our AI Readiness team. Someone who loves solving real problems with data and is excited by how AI is reshaping the game.

This is a client-facing role, so strong communication and engagement skills are key. You’ll own your work, move fast, and grow quickly with support from a tight-knit team of experienced data leaders. You’ll run end-to-end analytical projects, present insights that influence big decisions, and learn how to deliver faster and smarter using the latest AI tools.

It’s a unique blend: real impact, emerging tech, and continuous learning. Longer term, you’ll gain exposure across industries, clients, and business areas.

## Responsibilities and duties

You’ll be hands-on with real business problems, working directly with clients and teammates to turn messy questions into clean, powerful insights. Here’s an overview of what your responsibilities will be:

* Collaborate closely with clients and internal stakeholders to understand business challenges and shape data-driven solutions
* Translate commercial requirements into technical specs, then design and implement the data processes to bring them to life
* Own end-to-end delivery of smaller analytical projects, from scoping and planning to execution, insight generation, and presentation
* Perform deep analysis on complex datasets to extract insights that drive meaningful decisions
* Communicate findings and recommendations clearly through reports, dashboards, or direct conversations with stakeholders
* Proactively identify opportunities to improve data workflows, reporting, and business processes with AI and automation
* Ensure high data quality, consistent metrics, and strong data governance across projects
* Respond to ad hoc data requests and provide timely, accurate support to both clients and internal teams
* Mentor junior analysts through code reviews, guidance, and knowledge sharing
* Collaborate across functions such as including sales, engineering, and marketing to support broader business objectives
* Jump in to help with team initiatives outside the typical analyst role, such as organising team events and supporting the sales and marketing functions

## Ideal candidate

We’re after a passionate data analyst who’s not just technically strong, but eager to grow, experiment, and push what’s possible with data. You might be a great fit if you have:

* 3+ years of experience working in data analytics or a similar analytical role
* Strong SQL skills and hands-on experience with data visualisation tools like Tableau or Power BI
* A knack for turning complex data into clear, compelling stories, both in visuals and in conversation
* A solid understanding of complex customer data, data warehouses, and segmentation (bonus points if you've played with predictive models)
* A genuine interest in emerging tech, especially AI and how it’s changing the data landscape
* A strong attention to detail
* Critical thinking skills: you enjoy weighing different approaches and asking why, not just how

## Nice to haves or eager to learn on the job

We know not everyone comes with a perfect checklist, and that’s ok. If you already bring any of these to the table, or are excited to level up in these areas, we would love to hear from you:

* Tertiary qualifications in engineering, mathematics, actuarial studies, statistics, physics, or a related discipline
* Experience with Python, R, or other advanced analytics tools
* Exposure to AI tools or models, whether that’s experimenting with ChatGPT or building your own
* Experience working end-to-end on small projects, including presenting insights and owning outcomes
* Familiarity with version control tools like Git
* Experience working directly with clients, or in fast-paced, consulting-style environments
* Experience with sales and marketing analytics

## Our culture and core values

We’re building more than a business, we’re building a culture where smart, kind, driven people can do their best work. As an early member of the team, you’ll play a big role in shaping how we work, collaborate, and grow together.

Our values guide everything we do:

* **Human progress:** We work on problems that matter. We grow our own skills, especially the human ones, so we can have real-world impact.
* **Iterate quickly:** We move fast, start before things are perfect, and improve as we go. Feedback loops are short, and learning never stops.
* **Further together:** We win as a team. We lean on each other, our partners, and our network to go further than we could alone.
* **Be dependable:** We do what we say we’ll do, and we’ve got each other’s backs.
* **Have fun:** We celebrate wins, lift each other up, and make the journey motivating and fun.

If that sounds like a team you want to be part of and a culture you want to help shape, we’d love to meet you.
